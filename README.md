# Task 7: Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification
This project demonstrates the application and optimization of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers for breast cancer prediction using Python and scikit-learn. The work is part of the ElevateLabs machine learning task series.

## ðŸ“š Overview
Support Vector Machines are powerful supervised learning models used for classification problems. In this notebook, we:
- Load and preprocess a breast cancer dataset
- Build and evaluate an SVM classifier
- Optimize hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
- Visualize model performance (confusion matrix, decision boundaries)
- Discuss the importance of model tuning and further directions
